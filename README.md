# Dotfiles

These are my personal setup scripts and dotfile configuration for development.

## Prerequisites

- Install prerequisites via `setup.sh`. Make sure you have installed git (with no config).

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:rallieon/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
bash ./setup.sh
chmod a+x install.fish
./install.fish
```
